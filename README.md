     * [ ]  Transform & Implement Trained AI models onto Discrete Analog Hardware



### Upcoming Projects:
. You can Expect these projects to get live on GitHub Soon
- Raspberry Pi **CM4 Carrier Board**
- Feather FPGA Development board
- 16-Bit RISC CPU on FPGA
- A C++ based GUI Application for [#OpenADSP](https://github.com/maitesam/OpenADSP)
- And Finally, A custom HTML coded website for myself. 
  (Template will be Open Source)


And much more to come. Just someone catch the **TIME** for me.
